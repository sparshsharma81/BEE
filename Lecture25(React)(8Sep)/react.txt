react is a framework
nextjs is a framework built on top of react 


we can do scaling in the servers from express 
in nextjs..there is no specific packages or libraries for scaling
nextjs does the scaling automatically

react is a library


npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app 


npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app



in framework we need to follow proper structure 
in library we can do anything we want


framework is opinionated
framework -- need to follow proper structure defined by builder 


ESLint -- to check the code quality
there are several rules that we need to define that are in ESLint 
like to ignore error or show ...it is shown by estlint 



Prettier -- to format the code 
React -- to build UI 
Nextjs -- to build UI with server side rendering and other features




all the work of frontend is collected at a workplace 00
so we can do all the work in one place 




...we can achieve routing through two things.. -- page routing and app/folder based routing
