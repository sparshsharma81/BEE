now today we are doinng pagination and infinite scrolling
..basically there are two ways..to do it...
like we want that 

basically the backend is sipmle but frontend is complex 


like here we are using two things

1) offset and limit
2) cursor based pagination


and wee are using here two functions 

take and skip 
take is the limit --- how many records you want to fetch
skip is the offset --- how many records you want to skip



like for example..when we are in page 1 we will skip 0 records and take 10 records

..basically when in page 1 then the posts of 1 to 10 will be shown 
without skipping any of the records 


and when we are going in page2 then it should skip 10 records and take next 10 records
so that is done by the skip and take function 
basically the skip keywoard will skip the 10 records and take will take the next 10 records
