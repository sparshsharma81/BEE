relation database 

postgres sql


elephant db , big companies does not uses mongo db 
because of consistency
postgres sql is relational database


postgres sql and mysql stores data in the format of table 

relations are four types 
1 to 1 
many to 1 
1 to many 
many to many 



we need not to write manual queries ...so we just use prisma


prisma is an orm(Object relational mapping) tool 
prisma -- provides schema --- tables 

we can use prisma for mongodb also 



now after installing  it ...we need to connect it with nodejs project 



when we do changes in schmea -- we need to make it more to database 
and this is known as migration
..like in our prisma folder we have done changes in schema..prisma ..so 
we need to do migration 

npx prisma migrate dev --name userTable


npx prisma studio ---- this command is to manage the database like which tables do you have and what data are there in that
