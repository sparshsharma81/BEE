database ---- to store data separately so that any server crash/hack will not leak data 

relational ---- eq --- sql,mysql --- POSTGRESQL---- we can do it with prisma but we can do it without it also 

non-relational --- ex -- NoSql , MongoDb 


Non-relational 

SQL --- MongoDb 

----- it has two things --- system storage -- (localhost:27017),(Mongo Shell)
------cloud storage 

nodejs mongodb driver and mongoose...there are two things



-------------------MONGODB ARCHITECTURE
EVERY PROJECT HAS A CLUSTER AVAIABLE FOR FREE VERSION 

CLUSTER --- WE CONNECT OUR SERVER TO THIS 

a cluster can have multiple DB -----database 

same as a row in table ------ identity of a paritucular user 




-------------HOW TO CONNECT CLUSTER --------------
MongoDb NodeJS Driver 
mongoose 

------------we can connect with these two ---

npm i mongodb

.env is environment file which is avaiable globally 



client.db() ------ it will create database 


we should call mongodb in app.listen ... so that it is called once 


since it is asynchrnous function --- we can use .then and .catch 

whenever we have a work...that is done with asynchrnously..then we can 
make asynchrnous function or use promise 

and there we pass two things..resolve and reject...
if the task run successfully..we run resolve..else reject will get call 

.then() in promise---promise resolve successfully 
.catch() --- in promise --- if the promise is unsuccessfull..then it will go in .catch()
