we have to install the express using npm i express 
and initilze the package.json with npm init
and start application through nodemon


-------------nodemon is installed with npm i nodemon-------------



now after all the installation things..we are working with queryies...


ek variable ya datatype -- kisse bana hai..mtlb uska parent kon hai... 
javascript objects are derived from null

__proto__ = prototype chain accessor.

Use it to understand or manually set inheritance between objects.

Part of JavaScriptâ€™s object model and core inheritance mechanism.

dunedon proto --- 


ðŸ”„ __proto__ vs prototype
Term	What it is	Where it's used
__proto__	Points to the prototype of an object	All objects
prototype	Property of a function constructor	Used when creating new objects via new



------------------What is the prototype chain?------------
JavaScript objects form a chain:


Javascript 
student â†’ person â†’ Object.prototype â†’ null
This is used for inheritance: when a property/method is not found in the current object, it looks up the prototype chain.


whenever we create an object or variable..aur uske andar kitne methods hai --- to vo __proto__ (done dun proto) se pata chalta hai...


IMPORTANT --- PROTOTYPE ---------------------------------------------------

like array methods..push pop peek shift unshift --- they are defined in prototype 




 //ye basically params ka use kiya hai..?query params ka use hua hai isme...
                                                 //ye basically api se input k liye hota hai..
                                                 //jaise localhost:8000/api/abc?
                                                    /*
                                                 http://localhost:3000/profile?user=alice&id=101
                                                 This URL has:
                                                 ?user=alice&id=101 â†’ query string
 
                                                 user and id â†’ query parameters

                                                 alice and 101 â†’ values
                                                    */


Destructuring --- like in react use state 

const [num1, num2] = [1,2,3,4,5]

num1 contains 1 ;
num 2 contains 2;

these will store 2 variables --- like these has limitations ...
