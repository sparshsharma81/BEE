we have to install the express using npm i express

now after all the installation things..we are working with queryies...


ek variable ya datatype -- kisse bana hai..mtlb uska parent kon hai... 
javascript objects are derived from null

__proto__ = prototype chain accessor.

Use it to understand or manually set inheritance between objects.

Part of JavaScriptâ€™s object model and core inheritance mechanism.

dunedon proto --- 


ðŸ”„ __proto__ vs prototype
Term	What it is	Where it's used
__proto__	Points to the prototype of an object	All objects
prototype	Property of a function constructor	Used when creating new objects via new



------------------What is the prototype chain?------------
JavaScript objects form a chain:


Javascript 
student â†’ person â†’ Object.prototype â†’ null
This is used for inheritance: when a property/method is not found in the current object, it looks up the prototype chain.


whenever we create an object or variable..aur uske andar kitne methods hai --- to vo __proto__ (done dun proto) se pata chalta hai...


IMPORTANT --- PROTOTYPE ---------------------------------------------------

like array methods..push pop peek shift unshift --- they are defined in prototype
